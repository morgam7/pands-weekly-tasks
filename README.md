# Weekly Tasks Repository

This is the repository containing all the weekly tasks for the Programming and Scripting module of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics given by ATU Galway-Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics). My lecturer was [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31). Each week he set us the task of writing a simple python program using the new skills we had learnt.

To create this repository, I installed Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and as a text editor and terminal I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

## Week 1: Hello World!

We had to write a program that printed the words Hello World!

## Week 2: bank.py

We had to write a program that inputs and adds up two integers.

## Week 3: accounts.py

We had to write a program that inputs an account number and replaces all but the last 4 numbers with an X.

## Week 4: collatz.py

We had to write a program that inputs any positive integer and outputs the successive value by taking the current value. 
and, if it is even, dividing it by two, but if it is odd, multiplying it by three and adding one. The program continues until the last value is one.

## Week 8: plottask.py

we had to write a program that displays (1) a histogram of a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, and (2) a plot of the function h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, on the one set of axes.
