Things still to figure out:

How to replace a character in a string.

Also was trying to figure out how to just run a few lines of code. I know from tutorials that there's a command you could type in for this but found online that I should be able to use shift enter but couldn't figure it out. Will spend some time figuring this out next week.
Would be really handy to be able to hit shift+enter to run a section of code


Silly mistakes:
Was trying to change into pands_weekly_tasks_directory but this error message kept coming up:
.\pands-weekly-tasks\ : The term '.\pands-weekly-tasks\' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or 
operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

Realised I wasn't typing cd before to change into that directory!
