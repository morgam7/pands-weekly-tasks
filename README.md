Things still to figure out:

How to replace a character in a string.

Also was trying to figure out how to just run a few lines of code. I know from tutorials that there's a command you could type in for this but found online that I should be able to use shift enter but couldn't figure it out. Will spend some time figuring this out next week.
Would be really handy to be able to hit shift+enter to run a section of code


Silly mistakes:
Was trying to change into pands_weekly_tasks_directory but this error message kept coming up:
+ .\pands-weekly-tasks\
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (.\pands-weekly-tasks\:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

Realised I wasn't typing cd before to change into that directory! Took me like ten minutes to figure this out lol!

Silly Mistakes:

Could not figure out why my code was throwing up an error. I was usign the exact code that was in the labs and still getting error but then realised that I had started a line of code but not finished it way down the page. I hadn't even noticed that I hadn't deleted it. But the program wouldn't run becasue of that half line of code. I only realised it was there when I looked at the line nubmer in the error code - didn't realise that the error code gives you the line where the error is. very useful! - and I deleted the code fragment and the program worked.

Forgot to change string to int on first line - input automatically inputs as string
